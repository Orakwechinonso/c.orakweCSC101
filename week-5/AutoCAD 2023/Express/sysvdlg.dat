Controls when documents (DWG and DWT files) are unlocked in BIM 360 after they are closed in AutoCAD.\n\nValue\tDescription\n0\t\tDocuments are not immediately unlocked after you close them. When a document has been edited, saved, and closed, it is unlocked after the changes have finished uploading to BIM 360. This prevents another user from opening the document before the latest changes have finished uploading.  An "Unlocking file" action appears in the Autodesk Desktop Connector Pending Actions window after you close a document, even if no changes have been made to the document.\n1\t\tIn most scenarios, documents are immediately unlocked after you close them (the exception is when a document has unsaved changes), which can provide better performance. When a document is unlocked immediately after it is closed, an "Unlocking file" action does not appear in the Autodesk Desktop Connector Pending Actions window.\n\tIMPORTANT: When the CLOUDCOLLABMODIFIEDOPTION system variable is set to 1, documents that have been edited and saved are unlocked immediately after they are closed. Depending on when you close a document after saving it, it is possible that it may be unlocked in BIM 360 before the changes have finished uploading to BIM 360. To ensure that documents remain locked in BIM 360 until your changes have finished uploading, you can change the value of the CLOUDCOLLABMODIFIEDOPTION system variable to 0.\n\nNOTE: AutoCAD must be restarted after changing the value of this system variable.

#DATE|Real|Not saved|Varies
Stores the current date and time in Modified Julian Date format.\n\nThe Modified Julian Date (MJD) format is a Julian day number with decimal fraction of a day:\n\n\t<Julian day number>.<Decimal fraction of a day>\n\nThe Modified Julian Date, conventionally called UT1, is a worldwide scientific standard that assigns day numbers beginning at an essentially arbitrary date and time of 12:00 a.m. on 1 January 4713 B.C. (B.C.E.). With this system, 4 July 1997 at 2:29:58 p.m. corresponds to 2450634.60387736, and 1 January 1998 at 12:00 noon corresponds to 2450815.50000000.\n\nBecause the system clock provides the current date and time, the DATE system variable returns a true Julian date only if the system clock is set to UTC/Zulu (Greenwich Mean Time). TDCREATE and TDUPDATE have the same format as DATE, but their values represent the creation time and last update time of the current drawing.\n\nYou can compute differences in date and time by subtracting the numbers returned by DATE. The number of seconds since midnight can be computed by multiplying the decimal fraction of DATE by 86400 seconds.\n\nNOTE: Starting with AutoCAD 2017-based products, the current system date and time stored in the DATE system variable is accurate to the current second; whereas in previous releases the current system time also included milliseconds. If you are using the DATE system variable to track changes between a start and end time, be warned that you will no longer see a change in time until one second has elapsed even though 0 to 999 milliseconds might have passed. When needing to calculate differences in time smaller than one second, consider using the value returned by the MILLISECS system variable.\n\nIn AutoCAD-based products, not AutoCAD LT, AutoLISP can be used to calculate the number of seconds since midnight from the value returned by DATE.\n\n\t(setq s (getvar "DATE"))\n\t(setq seconds (* 86400.0 (- s (fix s))))\n\nNOTE: If you are using an AutoCAD-based product, not AutoCAD LT, the DATE Express Tool can be used as well as the DATE system variable. The DATE Express Tool functions like a command and uses a string format such as Mon 2012/5/7 10:29:10.563. To see the current value of the DATE system variable in AutoCAD-based products, enter SETVAR and then enter DATE at the prompt.

!ISAVEPERCENT|Integer|Registry|50
Controls the amount of space allocated in DWG files for incremental saves, which affects the number of quick save operations that can be performed before a full save is required.\n\nWhen the file save estimate exceeds the specified percentage, the next save will be a full save. Valid values can range from 0 to 100 percent.\n* A value of 0 means that all save operations are full saves. A full save optimizes the size of a DWG file, but is noticeably slower on large drawings.\n* A value of 100 increases the space available to append changes to the maximum possible. This value results in the greatest number of incremental quick save operations between full saves at the expense of larger file sizes.\n\nNOTE: To optimize speed, automatic saves are incremental, temporarily overriding the value of ISAVEPERCENT with a value of 90. A full save occurs when the number of changes exceeds the ISAVEPERCENT setting. Saving to a different format always results in a full save.

!LAYOUTREGENCTL|Integer|Registry|2
Specifies how the display list is updated in the Model tab and layout tabs.\n\nFor each tab, the display list is updated either by regenerating the drawing when you switch to that tab or by saving the display list to memory and regenerating only the modified objects when you switch to that tab. Changing the LAYOUTREGENCTL setting can improve performance.\n\nValue\tDescription\n0\t\tThe drawing is regenerated each time you switch tabs.\n1\t\tFor the Model tab and the last layout made current, the display list is saved to memory and regenerations are suppressed when you switch between the two tabs. For all other layouts, regenerations still occur when you switch to those tabs.\n2\t\tThe drawing is regenerated the first time you switch to each tab. For the remainder of the drawing session, the display list is saved to memory and regenerations are suppressed when you switch to those tabs.\n\nThe performance gain achieved by changing the LAYOUTREGENCTL setting is dependent on several factors, including the drawing size and type, the objects contained in the drawing, the amount of available memory, and the effect of other open drawings or applications. When LAYOUTREGENCTL is set to 1 or 2, the amount of additional memory used is the size of the Model tab's display list multiplied by the number of viewports in each layout for which the display list is saved.\n\nIf LAYOUTREGENCTL is set to 1 or 2 and performance seems slow in general or when you switch between tabs for which the display list is saved, consider changing to a setting of 0 or 1 to find the optimal balance for your work environment.\n\nRegardless of the LAYOUTREGENCTL setting, if you redefine a block or undo a tab switch, the drawing is regenerated the first time you switch to any tab that contains saved viewports.

!TREEDEPTH|Integer|Drawing|3020
Specifies the maximum depth, that is, the number of times the tree-structured spatial index can divide into branches.\n\nValue\tDescription\n0\t\tSuppresses the spatial index entirely, eliminating the performance improvements it provides in working with large drawings. This setting assures that objects are always processed in database order.\n>0\t\tTurns on spatial indexing. An integer of up to five digits is valid. The first three digits refer to model space, and the remaining two digits refer to paper space.\n<0\t\tTreats model space objects as 2D ( Z coordinates are ignored), as is always the case with paper space objects. Such a setting is appropriate for 2D drawings and makes more efficient use of memory without loss of performance\n\nNOTE: You cannot use TREEDEPTH transparently.
!TREEMAX|Integer|Registry|10000000
Limits memory consumption during drawing regeneration by limiting the number of nodes in the spatial index (oct-tree).\n\nBy imposing a fixed limit with TREEMAX, you can load drawings created on systems with more memory than your system and with a larger TREEDEPTH than your system can handle. These drawings, if left unchecked, have an oct-tree large enough to eventually consume more memory than is available to your computer. TREEMAX also provides a safeguard against experimentation with inappropriately high TREEDEPTH values.\n\nThe initial default for TREEMAX is 10000000 (10 million), a value high enough to effectively disable TREEMAX as a control for TREEDEPTH. The value to which you should set TREEMAX depends on your system's available RAM. You get about 15,000 oct-tree nodes per megabyte of RAM.\n\nIf you want an oct-tree to use up to, but no more than, 2 megabytes of RAM, set TREEMAX to 30000 (2 x 15,000). If the program runs out of memory allocating oct-tree nodes, restart, set TREEMAX to a smaller number, and try loading the drawing again.\n\nThe program might occasionally run into the limit you set with TREEMAX. Follow the resulting prompt instructions. Your ability to increase TREEMAX depends on your computer's available memory.

In Standard mode, you first specify all cutting or extension boundaries. Quick mode has the following effects:\n* All objects in the drawing automatically serve as cutting or extension boundaries.\n* By default, objects to be trimmed or extended can be selected with a two-point fence, a press-drag lasso, or individually.\n\nNOTE: Streamlined operation matches the TRIM and EXTEND operations in AutoCAD Web & Mobile.
!TRIMMODE|Integer|Registry|1
Controls whether selected edges for chamfers and fillets are trimmed.\n\nValue\tDescription\n0\t\tLeaves selected edges intact\n1\t\tTrims selected edges to the endpoints of chamfer lines and fillet arcs

(a period), there are no trusted folder paths in addition to the implicitly trusted ones.\n* When TRUSTEDPATHS includes a folder that ends with \... (backslash and three dots), all of its subfolders are also trusted.\n\nThe following folders are always trusted:\n* C:\Program Files\ and its subfolders\n* C:\Program Files (x86) and its subfolders\n\nNOTE: In some circumstances, it might be more convenient to specify the relative file path in the Filename parameter when using the LOAD function.\n* These trusted paths can also be specified in the Options dialog box >  Files tab, the Security Options dialog box, or in the Deployment Wizard.\n* The setting of the SECURELOAD system variable determines whether other locations, including the current drawing folder, are trusted. Signed DLLs are automatically trusted.\n\nNOTE: Beginning with AutoCAD 2013 SP1, the reserved acad2013.lsp and acad2013doc.lsp files and their successors are loaded only from their default installation folders: <install folder>\Support and <install folder>\Support\<language> respectively.
